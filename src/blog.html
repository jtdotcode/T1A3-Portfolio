            <h3>What is the JavaScript Eventloop?</h3>
          
          <p>The javascript event loop is a fundamental part of the javascript language. It's responsible for managing
            all the events that happen in the browser, and it handles all the processing that needs to happen in
            response to those events.

            The event loop is actually just a few pieces of code that live in the global context of the browser.
            Whenever an event occurs (like a button being clicked), the event loop calls the appropriate code to handle
            the event.

            The event loop works by handling events in three stages. First, it checks to see if there are any pending
            events. If there are, it starts processing those events. Next, it updates the DOM based on the results of
            the events. Finally, it calls any code that was registered to handle the event.

            This process happens constantly, and it's responsible for everything from loading the next page to
            responding to user input. It's a very fundamental part of the browser, and it's responsible for making sure
            that everything smooth and running as planned.</p>

            <h3>What are the Advantages of object oriented programming?</h3>
        

          <p>In general, object-oriented programming (OOP) is seen as a more comprehensive way of programming than
            traditional procedural programming. In OOP, programmers are encouraged to think in terms of objects and
            their interactions rather than in terms of individual lines of code. This approach can speed up program
            development and make it easier to change and expand a program.

            Another advantage of OOP is that it can make it easier to create reusable code. Rather than writing code
            specifically for a particular task, a programmer can create objects that can handle specific tasks. This
            allows the programmer to more easily modify and reuse the code.

            Finally, OOP can make it easier to manage data. In OOP, data is organized into objects. Each object
            represents a specific piece of data and provides facilities for accessing and manipulating that data. This
            makes it easy to keep track of the data and to ensure that it is properly stored and accessed.

            <h3>what is big o notation?</h3>
          
          <p>Big O notation is a notation for specifying the size of a computer algorithm's running time. It is based on
            the mathematical notation for the statement that a function is O(n). The term "big O notation" is sometimes
            used to refer to any notation for measuring the size of an algorithm. Other common notations for measuring
            algorithm size include "time complexity" and "space complexity".
